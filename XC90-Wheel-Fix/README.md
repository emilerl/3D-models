# Kids electric Volvo XC90 Wheel Fix
When my son turned 2 he got an electric, radio controlled Volvo XC90 kids car. After only a few test drives, the wheels started to come off and didn't attach to the axel anymore.

I took the wheel apart and found that the problem was the two pins that locks the wheel to the axel was only secured by a thin piece of transparent tape. With friction between the axel and pins, they would just rip through the tape and become misaligned.
First I tried to print a "collar" to go around the piece and keep the pins in place and it worked for a little while, but unfortunately it broke eventually.

So I instead decided to create a spacer and use an external circlip and a washer to keep the wheel in place. This thing is the result and it works like a charm.
The OpenSCAD file is attached for easy modification.

![Final product](https://github.com/emilerl/3D-models/blob/master/XC90-Wheel-Fix/Wheel%20Fix%20-%201.jpeg?raw=true)

You will need to buy 4x M5 washers (specifically with a outer diameter of 23.5mm and 2.4 mm deep, unless you want to adjust the design) and 4x external circlips for a 12mm axel.
