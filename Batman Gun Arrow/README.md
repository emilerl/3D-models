# Batman Gun Arrow
This is a spare arrow for the arrow gun that came with a Batman toy car. The arrows are quite small and can easily be misplaced, so this is a handy backup. 

Itâ€™s modelled in OpenSCAD for easy adjustments, depending on printer tolerances. The slit parameter can be used to configure with how much force the arrow should be shot. A higher value will compress the spring more and shoot it with higher force. 14mm is quite close to the original and I have found that values between 12-17mm will work.
